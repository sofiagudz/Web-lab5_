                With business slumping, Apple has been under pressure to show what it will offer buyers to jumpstart a new wave of iPhone sales.
On Monday, the technology giant revealed its hand - the iPhone 16 which has a camera button on the outside of the handset.
The button is an external clue to the changes Apple said it had made inside its latest smartphone, aimed at harnessing the latest in artificial intelligence (AI).
Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said the upgrades would "push the boundaries of what a smartphone can do" but the firm has tough competition, as other brands have already integrated generative AI features into their handsets.

                Apple's share price fell during its "Glowtime" event, where it unveiled the iPhone 16 as well as other products, and ended the day flat. The company, worth $3 trillion, is facing concern that it is losing its edge in the burgeoning area of artificial intelligence.
Sales of the iPhone - Apple's most important product which accounts for around half of its total sales - have stalled in recent months. They slipped by 1% over the nine months ended 29 June compared with a year earlier.

                    On Monday, Apple also 3 announced updates to its Apple Watch and its AirPod headphones, which will allow them to automatically drop the volume when users start in-person conversations and to decline calls with the shake of a head.
